<b>An all emcompasing solution in the form of a LMS for the differently abled students.</b>

To start the app you will have to download all of the dependencies, see the dependencies from the <b>package.json</b> and before that
install node in your machine.

To use the webapp clone all of the folders in a local folder <b>EXCEPT</b> Python App,
download this folder into your machine seperately in another local folder.

Open bash in both the local folders, in the Python App folder write "python app.py"
in the other folder's terminal write "nodemon app.js". Head over to your browser and search
<a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>.

You will find the link to the python local server at the bottom of the Resources section of the website.
